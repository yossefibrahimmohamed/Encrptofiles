# üîê AES File Encryptor & Decryptor

## Introduction:

This project allows you to encrypt and decrypt files using the **AES** algorithm in **CTR** mode. The scripts `encryption.py` and `decryption.py` handle file encryption and decryption using an AES key.

- **`encryption.py`**: Encrypts files using the AES algorithm in CTR mode.
- **`decryption.py`**: Decrypts files that were encrypted using the AES algorithm in CTR mode.

## Requirements:

1. **Python 3.6** or higher.
2. The **pycryptodome** library.

To install the required library, use the following command:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

Install it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yossefibrahimmohamed/Encrptofiles
```
